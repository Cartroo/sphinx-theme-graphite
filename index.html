<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A white-on-black theme for the <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> documentation generator. It has
slightly muted white text on various shades of dark grey. I created this
as I find light-on-dark themes typically easier on the eyes, since I tend
to use dark backgrounds on my terminals and I don't like flicking between
light and dark backgrounds frequently.</p>
<p>It uses a subtle text shadow and rounded corners to improve legibility, but
it should also render accpetably on browsers which don't support these CSS
features.</p>
<p>The theme should cover most common constructions, but it's possible there
are some classes I've missed. It also includes a Pygments theme which I
think complements it without being overly bright.</p>
